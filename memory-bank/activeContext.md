# Active Context: InstaTool

## Current Focus
MERN stack foundation 90% complete. **Task 9 COMPLETED** - Backend API fully functional. Ready for database operations and CSV processing.

## Recent Discoveries & Achievements
- âœ… **Task 9 COMPLETED**: Backend API responses fully debugged and working
- âœ… MongoDB Atlas connection successful (password encoding issue resolved)
- âœ… All API endpoints operational: /api/health, /api/posts, /api/upload
- âœ… CSV upload system configured and tested
- âœ… "npm run everything" script created for easy development startup
- CSV structure confirmed: `post_title, theme, scheduled_for, page_1_content, page_2_content, etc.`
- 5 Islamic themes required with visual variety
- Text-only content with themed backgrounds
- Single user MVP, authentication later
- GitHub repo needs to be created manually: `insta-tool` under `maxim-nizhar`

## Next Immediate Steps (For Next Session)
1. **Task 10: Verify MongoDB Atlas** - Test database operations and CRUD functionality
2. **Task 11: Create Schemas** - Build Post and Project MongoDB models  
3. **Task 12: CSV Processing** - Implement CSV parsing and post generation
4. **Create GitHub Repository** - Follow memory-bank/GITHUB_SETUP.md instructions (user manual task)
5. **Test Full Flow** - Verify "npm run everything" works perfectly

## Key Decisions Made
- **CSV Format**: `post_title, theme, scheduled_for, page_1_content, page_2_content` etc.
- **Image Size**: 1080x1080px Instagram standard
- **Scheduling**: ISO 8601 format, single timezone
- **Database Structure**: Day-based projects containing posts
- **Theme System**: 5 fixed Islamic themes with static backgrounds

## Critical Implementation Notes
- **Tailwind Setup**: User specifically mentioned I "always fail" at Tailwind setup - need to be extra careful
- **MongoDB Credentials**: Store in .env, connection string provided
- **Font Support**: CSV field for font selection (slug/name or "default")
- **No Authentication**: Single user MVP, add later

## Project Priorities

### MVP Features (Current Sprint)
1. CSV upload and parsing
2. Post generation with Islamic themes  
3. Basic scheduling system
4. Post editing interface
5. Day-based project organization

### High Priority Post-MVP
1. Backup/Export posts as images
2. Duplicate protection
3. Draft mode

### Future Quality of Life Features
- Bulk operations (delete/reschedule multiple)
- Preview mode (Instagram-like)
- Template library
- Analytics tracking
- Content validation
- Collaboration features

## Technical Constraints
- MERN stack + Tailwind required
- MongoDB Atlas connection provided
- dotenv for credentials
- Package.json with multiple scripts
- Instagram Business API integration (future)

## User Preferences
- Prefers text overlays on themed backgrounds
- Islamic aesthetic with cultural appropriateness
- Batch workflow for efficiency
- Clear UI for post management
- Precise scheduling capabilities

## Questions Resolved
- CSV structure âœ“
- Content type (text only) âœ“  
- Theme requirements (5 Islamic themes) âœ“
- Image specifications (1080x1080) âœ“
- Authentication (none for MVP) âœ“
- Scheduling format (ISO 8601) âœ“
- Database credentials âœ“

## For Next Session
**Simply say "Do Task 10" to test database operations or "Do Task 11" to create MongoDB schemas**

## ðŸš€ Quick Start Command
**From project root:** `npm run everything` - This will kill any processes on ports 5173/3001 and start both frontend and backend fresh!
