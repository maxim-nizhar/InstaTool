## ðŸ”¥ Task 9 Completion Details (CRITICAL REFERENCE)

### Issues Found & Fixed:
1. **MongoDB URI Malformed Error** 
   - Problem: Special characters in password `*@!**^9862%@247c%8S43` not URL-encoded
   - Solution: Used `encodeURIComponent()` in server.js line 19-21
   - Result: âœ… Connected to MongoDB Atlas successfully

2. **Missing API Routes**
   - Problem: All routes commented out in server.js, empty routes/controllers directories  
   - Solution: Created working routes: `/api/health`, `/api/posts`, `/api/upload`
   - Files created: `server/routes/posts.js`, `server/routes/upload.js`
   - Result: âœ… All endpoints responding correctly

3. **CSV Upload System**
   - Problem: File upload not configured
   - Solution: Configured multer with CSV validation and uploads/ directory
   - Result: âœ… CSV files upload successfully with proper validation

4. **Server Process Management**
   - Problem: Server not staying running, background process issues
   - Solution: Used nohup for background processes, proper port management
   - Result: âœ… Server runs stable on port 3001

### Verified Working Endpoints:
```bash
GET  /api/health  â†’ {"status":"OK","message":"InstaTool server is running","timestamp":"..."}
GET  /api/posts   â†’ {"message":"Posts endpoint working","posts":[]}  
POST /api/posts   â†’ Accepts JSON, echoes back data
POST /api/upload  â†’ Accepts CSV files, returns file info
```

### Technical Implementation:
- **MongoDB Connection**: `mongodb+srv://strongbox5695:${encodedPassword}@cluster000.n00tsc0.mongodb.net/`
- **Server Port**: 3001 (confirmed working)
- **File Upload**: Configured with multer, validates CSV by extension and MIME type
- **Error Handling**: Global error middleware with stack traces in development
- **Security**: CORS enabled, helmet security headers, morgan logging
- **Process**: Server runs via `nohup node server.js > server.log 2>&1 &`

### Files Modified:
- `server/server.js`: MongoDB connection fix, routes enabled
- `server/routes/posts.js`: Created with GET/POST endpoints
- `server/routes/upload.js`: Created with CSV upload handling
- `package.json`: Added "npm run everything" script with port killing
